What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Initializing a repository starts the version tracking process and creates a hidden .git folder. This let's git know that these files need to be version-tracked in the .git folder.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is where files are placed before being committed. Multiple files associated with a logical change can be bundled together into one commit in this way as well. The working directory
contains all files that are / are not tracked. The repository stores files that are being tracked (that have been committed).
